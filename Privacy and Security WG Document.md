### Privacy and Security
### The World For Which We Work
By 2025, conversational AI will be a primacy interface to the connected digital world of content, enterprises, things, and persons.  It will be accessed and used through multiple assistants, multiple platforms, and nearly all digital devices.
### Problem Statement per meeting 2020.07.01
Draft Privacy and Security Working Group Problem Statement - Voice Technology has the power to change our lives, however with voice technology comes a new set of privacy and security risks and concerns that are inherently linked with the adoption and trust of the technology. The goal is to identify and extend existing open privacy and security standards, and guidance with detail specific to voice technologies.
### Problem Statements Unique to Voice in re: Privacy
- the claiming by proprietary platforms of all personal and commercial data communicated through said platforms
- absence of workable guidelines and regulations as to the 1) content-based sharing of voice data, including biometric and biomarker data, and 2) enterprise ethical use and security of personal, biometric, and biomarker data.
- Other key points to discuss and integrate:
WRT Privacy and Security, what makes voice different?
- Its always listening
- Its subjective
- It involves biometrics
- Commercial vs. Private viewpoints
- Data ownership and data sharing
### Aspirational Requirements: Privacy
Per meeting of 2020.07.14, issues for consideration -- for further discussion :
- consent, which includes the issue of awareness
- ownership, which includes user control and sharing
- use, which may include ownership, cointrol, and sharing
- control 
Per J. Stine slide:  what do we seek to achieve in addition to the privacy guidelines/regulations of NIST, GDPR, CCPA, the Vatican, etc.?  Proposed:
- transparent, readily-available, consent-based opportunity for direct, unfiltered connection between entities
- transparent, readily-available, consent-based opportunity for data sharing, including biometric and biomarker data
- transparency of data collection and analysis process and intent
### Technical Capabilities to Enable Requirements: Privacy

- 1.0 problem statement, and initial listing of requirements and capabilities, as per this document:  2020.08.04
