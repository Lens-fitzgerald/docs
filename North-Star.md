### Vision of the Open Voice Network: our North Star ###

Ours is an initiative for a coming world of conversational artificial intelligence -- a world of where hundreds (if not thousands) of voice assistants provide multi-modal communication through every type of digital device, and in every vertical industry.  This is a world that promises significant value not only to conversational AI providers, but to the users of conversational AI -- the enterprises, marketers and communicators, operational managers, developers and designers, and billions of individuals worldwide.

At present, a broad set of issues -- all centered around a lack of user trust -- clouds the future of conversational AI, and inhibits the realization of user value.  These include distrust in conversational AI's ease and reliability of use, its ability to provide direct and unfiltered access to desired destinations, its commercial and personal practices regarding data usage and privacy, its lack cross-platform interoperability, its struggle to provide unbiased and inclusive access.  

To reach its potential, conversational AI must be made worthy of user trust. 

Through the centuries, the development and adoption of standards has repeatedly catalyzed ever-advancing use, innovation, ecosystem development, and economic growth for new technologies.  We, the sponsors and supporters of The Open Voice Network, believe that now -- at the dawn of conversational AI's multi-assistant future -- is the time to communally develop and drive toward adoption the conversational AI standards and ethical use guidelines that will enable user trust.  

Why an organization such as The Open Voice Network?  We bring a neutral perspective, as befitting a global non-profit Directed Fund of The Linux Foundation.  We approach the issues from the perspective of the current and prospective users of conversational AI.  And, we are solely focused on the future of conversational AI, and the governing standards and guidelines that will create the greatest value (broadly defined) for the most.   As such, we will work in an open and transparent manner; we will work in a communal manner, seeking ideas, comment, and criticism from a broad and diverse spectrum of users; and, we will work in collaboration with existing standards bodies where appropriate.  

Our work could include the development and proposal of standards that will enable:
- privacy-friendly invocation
- intentional and consent-based security
- platform-independent and dependable destination accessibility
- platform-independent user identification and authentication
- the interoperability of conversational AI platforms
- intentional and consent-driven commercial and consumer privacy 
- commands and phraseology for common business processes
- language and dialect inclusivity
- multi-modal input and output
