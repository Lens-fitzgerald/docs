# Voice Registry System ReadMe
The [Voice Registry System](https://github.com/open-voice-network/docs/blob/master/components/voice_registry_system.md) document will provide the scope, requirements, terminology alignment, architectural design, and implementation guidelines.


## Terminology Alignment
For the working group that is as diverse as us from different countries, companies, industries, specialty, and backgrounds, we must define each word similarly and meant the same way. To use an analogy of a car, a wheel alignment is critical because this is one necessary factor that can significantly affect how the vehicle will run and allay any accidents. The goal is to save time, remove confusion, and be concise with our discussion. In short, we should be speaking the same language as a cohesive team.

If you are new to the group, please review the terminology alignment section in the VRS document.


## Working Style
- In general, VRS follows the [working ways guidelines](https://github.com/open-voice-network/docs/blob/master/way_of_working.md).
- To get access to the tools we use, please follow the instruction [here](https://github.com/open-voice-network/docs/blob/master/way_of_working.md).
- The working group meets every Thursday every two weeks, 9 AM CST. If you are interested in being added, please contact OVN Executive Director (jon.stine@openvoicenetwork.org).
- The working group leverages the [github issue](https://github.com/open-voice-network/docs/issues) for any great discussion that we need to track. For easy filtering, please make sure to label the issue with VRS properly. 
- For any question or discussion outside of the meeting time, we leverage [Slack](https://openvoicenetwork.slack.com). Our channel is the #voice-registry-system.
- The meeting minutes and decision are captured in this [document](https://github.com/open-voice-network/docs/blob/master/components/voice_registry_system_meeting_notes.md)


## Contributing to the VRS document
- There are 2 ways to start with this:
  (1) Fork it,  see [link](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/)
  (2) Clone it from the original repository, see  [link](https://github.com/cubeton/git101/blob/master/TurtorialInfo/Tutorial.md)
- Whatever steps you followed above, you will end in Pull Request, also known as PR.
- In PR process, you will not see your changes right away. It is an area of discussion, where the reviewer can ask for more questions or clarification about the changes you made. It is **best practice** to attach the issue number, so it is easier to understand the changes' background.
