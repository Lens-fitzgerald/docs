# Voice Registry System

### Problem Context
Today, voice assistance is dominated by proprietary, cloud-centric conversation platforms that deliver services using closed implementations.  Examples of these are Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, Microsoft Cortana, and Apple Siri.  Whenever an "explicit invocation" is invoked by the user, each proprietary platforms have different standards (i.e., brand vocabulary, etc) and processes on how they are triggered or verified. This is a problem for the business and users. Users and businesses will not have consistent experiences in dealing with the various conversational platform. Businesses are at the commiseration of every single conversational platform on how they're transactions are getting triggered on the conversational space.
