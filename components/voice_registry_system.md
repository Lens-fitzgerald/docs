# Voice Registry System

### Overview
Voice Registry System (VRS) is one of the components  in the
[Technical Masterplan](https://github.com/open-voice-network/docs/blob/master/technical_masterplan.md). The purpose of this document is to address the problem context of the VRS and why it is essential to resolve it. 

VRS's goal is to provide a consistent experience for the users and create an equal treatment for the business despite their size - regardless of the conversational platform.

### Terminology Alignment
- **Channel** - an interface and origin of communication. It is where the utterances are received. Examples: voice assistance devices, mobile phones, web sites, etc.
- **Conversational Platform** - the system or services that handle the two-way interaction with the user and the business.  The platform owns the task of understanding the user's utterance, translating it to humans, and machine exchange, and making sure it is reaching the right business. 
- **User** - a person who interacts with channels.  
- **Business** - a commercial entity, services, or company.


### Problem Context
Today, voice assistance is dominated by proprietary, cloud-centric conversation platforms that deliver services using closed implementations.  Examples of these are Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, Microsoft Cortana, and Apple Siri.  Whenever an "explicit invocation" is invoked by the user, each proprietary platforms have different standards (i.e., brand vocabulary, etc) and processes on how they are triggered or verified. 

This is a problem for the business and users. Users and businesses will not have consistent experiences in dealing with the various conversational platform. Businesses are at the commiseration of every single conversational platform on how they're transactions are getting triggered on the conversational space.
